/*Add all general styles to this file. General styles means anything common on every page.
  Such as:
  Headers, Footers, Hero(top large call out) Areas, buttons, flexbox containers, link styles, etc.
  If there are ids that use the same properties list them like so: #ask, #container {}
  If there are common classes put them here
*/

/* Header: remove z-index */
/* Remove all position and top, left, bottom, right properties. Properly used but not necessary. Use flexbox */
/* Remove all float properties and use flexbox. */
/* Don't set height unless you're specifying a fixed height. Keeps the content from overflowing. */
